===========


Installation
------------

There are two methods to install AdaptivePELE [APELE]_, from PyPI (recommended) or directly from source.

To install from PyPI simply run::

    pip install AdaptivePELE

To install from source, you need to install and compile cython files in the base folder with::

    git clone https://github.com/AdaptivePELE/AdaptivePELE.git
    cd AdaptivePELE
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Also, if AdaptivePELE was not installed in a typical library directory, a common option is to add it to your local PYTHONPATH::

    export PYTHONPATH="/location/of/AdaptivePELE:$PYTHONPATH"


Overview
--------

This page tries to give an overview of AdaptivePELE, enough to get it
up and running. The program aims to enhance the exploration of standard
molecular simulations by iteratively running short simulations, 
assessing the exploration with a clustering, and spawning new trajectories
in *interesting* regions using the multi-armed bandit as a framework.
The algorithm can be summarized in the flow diagram shown below:

Control file outline
--------------------

AdaptivePELE is a Python program called with a parameter: the control 
file.

::

    python -m AdaptivePELE.adaptiveSampling controlFile.conf

The control file is a JSON document that permits tuning its behavior. It contains 4 blocks: 
the general parameters, simulation parameters, clustering
parameters and spawning parameters. The first block refers to general
parameters such as the output path, initial structures, or whether to restart (resume) a simulation. 
The other three blocks configure the three iterative steps of an adaptive run, and have a 
``{"type":str, "params":{}, "optionalClasses":{}}`` structure. Namely, the **simulation** block 
chooses and tunes the propagation algorithm, typically PELE, the **clustering** block tunes the clustering method,
cluster sizes... and the **spawning** block selects the strategy to choose the most interesting
structures. 

::

        {
            "generalParams" : {},
            "simulation": {"type":str, "params":{}},
            "clustering": {"type":str, "params":{}},
            "spawning": {"type":str, "params":{}}
        }


GeneralParams block
-------------------

These parameters control the general aspects of the simulation, such as the initial structures or the output path.
For example, if you consider that a simulation did not explore the energy landscape sufficiently, 
it can be automatically resumed. In this case, if you change the clustering parameters from the previous run,
it will need the trajectory files to recluster all snapshots. Otherwise, it is enough with the automatically 
handled clustering objects.
If you want to test the effect of using a particular cluster threshold or spawning parameter (see below),
using debug=true may be a great option.



Parameters
..........

The general parameters block has five possible fields:

* **restart** (*boolean*, default=True): This parameter specifies whether you want to
  continue a previous simulation or not. It requires the last epoch's clustering object, 
  which is stored as a binary file to optimize disk usage.

* **debug** (*boolean*, default=False): Run adaptive in debug mode, without calling
  any propagation algorithm. Typically used to tinker with the clustering/spawning.

* **outputPath** (*string*, mandatory): The path where the results of the simulation will be
  written

* **initialStructures** (*list*, mandatory): The path(s) to the intial structure(s)

* **writeAllClusteringStructures** (*boolean*, default=False): Whether to write all the cluster 
  center structures as pdbs. Setting it to True is inneficient, and cluster center structures 
  can still be recovered from the binary clustering object.

Additionaly, it can also have a nativeStructure parameter, a string containing
the path to the native structure. This structure will only be used to correct
the RMSD in case of symmetries. The symmetries will also have to be specified
(see `clustering block`_).

Example::

    "generalParams" : { 
        "restart": false,
        "debug" : false,
        "outputPath":"simulationOutput",
        "nativeStructure" : "nativeStructure.pdb",
        "initialStructures" : ["initial1.pdb", "initial2.pdb"]
    }

Simulation block
-----------------

Currently, there are three implemented simulation types: 

* **pele**. `PELE <https://pele.bsc.es/pele.wt>`_ is a great tool to efficiently explore the energy landscape. Parameters have been optimized for its use.

* **test**. The test type has no real use outside of testing. 

* **MD** Run molecular dynamics using the OpenMM [OPENMM]_ library.


Templetized PELE control file
.............................

In order to run adaptivePELE, PELE control file needs to be templetized. In particular:

* **MultipleComplexes"**: AdaptivePELE requieres the use of multiple complexes: ``"MultipleComplex": [ $COMPLEXES ]``

* **seed**: The seed needs to be templetized: ``"seed": $SEED``

* **outputPath**: The output path needs to be changed for: ``"reportPath": "$OUTPUT_PATH/report"``

* **numberOfPeleSteps**: The number of pele steps needs to be templetized as ``"numberOfPeleSteps": $PELE_STEPS``

Optionally other fields might be templetized as well:

* **fixedCenter**: The center of the simulation box is templetized as ``"fixedCenter": $BOX_CENTER``

* **radius**: The radius of the simulation box is templetized as ``"radius": $BOX_RADIUS``  

* **reportName**: The name of the report file is templetized as ``"reportPath": "$OUTPUT_PATH/$REPORT_NAME"``. Note that the value of the reportName is not a parameter of the simulation block, but is given by the **reportFilename** option of the spawning block

* **trajectoryName**: The name of the trajectory file is templetized as ``"trajectoryPath": "$OUTPUT_PATH/$TRAJECTORY_NAME"``

  moment this was written)
* **constraints** (*list*, default=None): List of constraints between atoms to
  establish in a simulation. The constraints must be specified as a list in the
  following format (see `Control File Examples`_ section for an example on how

Exit condition
..............

Additionally, the simulation block may have an exit condition that stops the execution:

* **exitCondition** (*dict*, default=None): Block that specifies an exit condition for the simulation.
  Currently two types are implemented: *metric* and
  *metricMultipleTrajectories*.

  * **metric** : 
    this type accepts a *metricCol* which represents a column in the report file, an *exitValue* 
    which represents a value for the metric and a *condition* parameter which can
    be either "<" or ">", default value is "<". The simulation will terminate after the metric
    written in the *metricCol* reaches a value smaller or greater than *exitValue*, depending on the condition specified. 
    An example of the exit condition block that would terminate the program after a trajectory reaches a value of less 
    than 2 for the fifth column (4th starting to count from 0) of the report file would look like::

        "exitCondition" : {
            "type" : "metric",
            "params" : {
                "metricCol" : 4,
                "exitValue" : 2.0,
                "condition" : "<"
            }
        }

  * **metricMultipleTrajectories** : 
    this type accepts a *metricCol* which represents a column in the report file, an *exitValue* 
    which represents a value for the metric, a *condition* parameter which can
    be either "<" or ">", default value is "<" and a *numberTrajectories* parameter which determines how many independent trajectories
    have to meet the condition for the simulation to stop. The simulation will terminate after the metric
    written in the *metricCol* reaches a value smaller or greater than *exitValue*, depending on the condition specified for a
    number of trajectories greater or equal than *numberTrajectories*. An example of the exit condition block that would terminate the 
    program after 10 trajectories reach a value of more than 2 for the fifth column (4th starting to count from 0) of the report 
    file would look like::

        "exitCondition" : {
            "type" : "metricMultipleTrajectories",
            "params" : {
                "metricCol" : 4,
                "exitValue" : 2.0,
                "condition" : ">",
                "numberTrajectoriess" : 10
            }
        }

Example of a minimal simulation block::

    "simulation": {
        "type" : "pele",
        "params" : { 
            "iterations" : 25,
            "processors" : 128,
            "peleSteps" : 4,
            "seed": 30689,
            "controlFile" : "templetizedPELEControlFile.conf"
        }   
    }


Clustering block
----------------

Currently there are four functional types of clustering:

* **rmsd**, which solely uses the ligand rmsd

* **contactMap**, which uses a protein-ligand contact map matrix

* **null**, which produces no clustering

* **MSM**, which uses a kmeans clustering to estimate a Markov State
  Model (MSM)

The first two clusterings are based on the leader algorithm, an extremely fast clustering method that in the 
worst case makes *kN* comparisons, where *N* is the number of snapshots to cluster and *k* the number of existing clusters.
The procedure is as follows. Given some clusters, a conformation is said to belong to a cluster 
when it differs in less than a certain metric threshold (e.g. ligand RMSD)
to the corresponding cluster center. Cluster centers are always compared in the same order, and,
if there is no similar cluster, it generates a new one. 

Aside from the speed, a big advantage of using this method 
is that it permits the user to define different criteria in different regions.
This way, we can optimize the number of clusters, giving more importance to regions with more interactions,
potentially being more metastable.

In order to measure the potential metastability, 
we use the ratio of the number of protein-ligand heavy atom contacts over the number of ligand heavy atoms, *r*. 
Two atoms are considered to be in contact if the distance between 
them is less than a certain **contactThreshold** (8Å by default). Although these values depend on the particular
protein-ligand geometry and ligand size, this measure is more ligand-independent compared to the overall
number of contacts and a value of 1 typically indicates that the ligand is on the surface entering a protein pocket.
We encourage the use of default parameters with very few exceptions such as in the study 
of the diffusion of ions or tiny molecules (e.g. a oxygen molecule).


ThresholdCalculator
...................

* **constant**, where all clusters have the same threshold. A sound value may be 3Å.

* **heaviside** (default), where thesholds (values) are assigned according to a set of step functions that 
  vary according to a ratio of protein-ligand contacts and ligand size , *r*, (conditions, see below). The values and conditions 
  of change are defined with two lists. The condition list is iterated until *r* > condition[i], and the used
  threshold is values[i]. If r <= conditions[i] for all i, it returns the last element in values. 
  Thresholds typically vary from 5Å in the bulk to 2Å in protein pockets. This method is preferred, as it
  optimizes the number of clusters, giving more importance to regions with more contacts and interactions, 
  where metastability occurs. Default values: [2,3,4,5], default conditions: [1, 0.75, 0.5].

Rmsd clustering
...............

In the **rmsd** clustering, if the RMSD between two ligand conformations is less than 
a certain threshold, the conformation is added to the cluster, and otherwise, a new cluster 
is generated.


ContactMap clustering
.....................

The **contactMap** uses the similarity between protein-ligand contact maps.
The contact map is a boolean matrix with the protein
atoms (or a subset of them, typically one or two per residue) as columns and 
ligand atoms (typically only heavy atoms) as rows, and a value of True indicates a contact.
There are currently three implemented methods to evaluate the similarity of contactMaps:

* **Jaccard**, which calulates the Jaccard Index (`Wikipedia page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index>`_). The recommended values using the heaviside threshold calculator are [0.375, 0.5, 0.55, 0.7] for the conditions [1, 0.75 , 0.5].

* **correlation**, which calculates the correlation between the two matrices

* **distance**, which evaluates the similarity of two contactMaps by calculating the ratio of the number of differences over the average of elements in the contacts maps.


Null clustering
...............

The **null** clustering produces no clustering, this is useful when running
long simulations, were no spawning is needed, it saves memory and computional
time.

MSM Clustering
..............

The **MSM** clusters a simulation in order to estimate an MSM, this includes
the possibility of preprocessing the trajectories with the TICA method [TICA]_

Parameters
..........

* **ligandResname** (*string*, default=""): Ligand residue name in the PDB (if necessary)
* **ligandChain** (*string*, default=""): Ligand chain (if necessary)
* **ligandResnum** (*int*, default=0): Ligand residue number (if necessary). If 0 or not specified, it is ignored. The ligand ought to be univoquely identified with any combination of this and the two former parameters
* **contactThresholdDistance** (*float*, default=8): Maximum distance at which two atoms have to
  be separated to be considered in contact
* **symmetries** (*list*, default=[]): List of symmetry groups of key:value maps with the names of atoms
  that are symmetrical in the ligand
* **similarityEvaluator** (*string*, mandatory):  Name of the method to evaluate the similarity
  of contactMaps, only available and mandatory in the contactMap clustering
* **alternativeStructure** (*bool*, default=False): It stores alternative spawning structures within each cluster to be used in the spawning (see below). Any two pairs of alternative structures within a cluster are separated a minimum distance of cluster_threshold_distance/2.
* **nclusters** (*int*, mandatory for MSM): Number of clusters to generate
* **tica** (*bool*, default=False): Whether to use TICA to preprocess the
  trajectories, only used for MSM clustering
* **atom_Ids** (*list*, default=[]): List of atoms whose coordinates should be
  used for the clustering, specifed as serial:atomname:residue, e.g.
  3232:C1:696, only used for MSM clustering
* **writeCA** (*bool*, default=False): Whether to use the alpha carbons in the
  clustering, this is typically used when using tica, only used for MSM clustering
* **sidechains** (*bool*, default=False): Whether to use the sidechains in
  contact with the ligand for clustering, this is typically used when using tica, only used for MSM clustering
* **tica_lagtime** (*int*, default=10): Lagtime to use in the tica method , only used for MSM clustering
* **tica_nICs** (*int*, default=3): Number of independent components from tica
  to use in the clustering, only used for MSM clustering
* **tica_kinetic_map** (*bool*, default=True): Whether to use the kinetic map
  distance with TICA
* **tica_commute_map** (*bool*, default=False): Whether to use the commute map
  distance with TICA


Example
.......

A typical setting of the rmsd clustering is::

    "clustering" : { 
        "type" : "rmsd",
        "params" : { 
            "ligandResname" : "AEN",
            "contactThresholdDistance" : 8,  
            "symmetries": [{"3225:C3:AEN":"3227:C5:AEN","3224:C2:AEN":"3228:C6:AEN"}, {"3230:N1:AEN": "3231:N2:AEN"}]
        },  
        "thresholdCalculator" : { 
            "type" : "heaviside",
            "params" : { 
                "values" : [2, 3, 4, 5], 
                "conditions": [1.0, 0.75, 0.5]
            }   
        }   
    }

which, given the default options, is equivalent to::

    "clustering" : { 
        "type" : "rmsd",
        "params" : { 
            "ligandResname" : "AEN",
            "symmetries": [{"3225:C3:AEN":"3227:C5:AEN","3224:C2:AEN":"3228:C6:AEN"}, {"3230:N1:AEN": "3231:N2:AEN"}]
        }  
    }


In this exemple, clusters having a contacts ration greater than 1 have a
treshold of 2, those with contacts ratio between 1 and 0.75 have a treshold of
3, between 0.75 and 0.5 a threshold of 4 and the rest have a threshold size of
5. This means that for greater contacts ratio, typically closer to the binding site,
the cluster size will be smaller and therefore those regions will be more
finely discretized.

Example of contactMap clustering::

    clustering: {
        "type": "contactMap",
        "params": {
            "ligandResname": "AIN",
            "contactThresholdDistance": 8,
            "similarityEvaluator": "correlation"
        },
        "thresholdCalculator": {
            "type": "constant",
            "params": {
                "value": 0.15
            }
        }

Example of MSM clustering::

    clustering: {
        "type": "MSM",
        "params": {
            "ligandResname": "BEN",
            "nclusters": 100
        }
    }

Example of null clustering::

    clustering: {
        "type": "null",
        "params": {}
    }

    

Spawning block
---------------

Spawning types
..............

Finally, trajectories are spawned in different *interesting* clusters, according to a reward function.
There are several implemented strategies:

* **sameWeight**: Uniformly distributes the processors over all clusters

* **inverselyProportional**: Distributes the processors with a weight that is inversely proportional to the cluster population.

* **epsilon**: An *epsilon* fraction of processors are distributed proportionally to the value of a metric, and the rest are inverselyProportional distributed.  A param **n** can be specified to only consider the *n* clusters with best metric.

* **variableEpsilon**: Equivalent to epsilon, with an epsilon value changing over time

* **independent**: Trajectories are run independently, as in the original PELE. It may be useful to restart simulations or to use the analysis scripts built for AdaptivePELE.

* **independentMetric**: Trajectories are run independently, as in the original PELE. However in this method, instead of starting the next epoch from the last snapshot of the previous we start from the one that maximizes or minimizes a certain metric.

* **UCB**: Upper confidence bound.

* **FAST**: FAST strategy (see J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2015, 11 (12), pp 5747–5757).

* **ProbabilityMSM**: Distributes the processors with a weight that is
  proportional to the stationary probability of each cluster in an MSM (see [MSM]_ for more details, needs to be used with `MSM Clustering`_)

* **MetastabilityMSM** Distributes the processors with a weight that is
  proportional to the metastability of each cluster in an MSM calulated as q :sub:`ii`/*N*, where q :sub:`ii` is the number of self-transitions of state i and N is the total number of counts for the simulation (needs to be used with `MSM Clustering`_)

* **IndependentMSM** Trajectories are run independently, as in the
  **independent** method, but an MSM is calculated at the end of each iteration
  and the results are reported in the form of two plots, one of the stationary
  distribution and one of the probability of binding (PMF)

According to our experience, the best strategies are **inverselyProportional** and **epsilon**, guided with either PELE binding energy or the RMSD to the bound pose if available.


Density calculator
..................

Each cluster is assigned a relative density of points compared to other clusters.
Again, and in analogy to the threshold calculator, the aim is to give more emphasis to interesting regions.
There are two types of density calculators:

* **constant** (or **null**, default), which assigns the same density to all the clusters regardless of the number of contacts

* **heaviside**, which assigns different densities using a heaviside function, much like the thresholdCalculator (values and conditions are mandatory)

* **continuous**, which assings increasing densities for an increasing number of contacts. Default values, if **r** > 1, density = 8, otherwise, density = 64.0/(-4 **r** + 6)^3

* **exitContinuous**, which assings decreasing densities for an increasing number of contacts. Default values, if **r** > 1, density = 1/8, otherwise, density = (-4 **r** + 6)^3/64.0

Parameters
..........

* **reportFilename** (*string*, mandatory): Basename to match the report file with metrics. E.g. "report". 

* **metricColumnInReport** (*integer*, mandatory): Column of the report file that contains the metric of interest (one indexed)

* **epsilon** (*float*, mandatory in **epsilon** spawning): The fraction of the processors that will be assigned according to the selected metric

* **metricWeights** (*string*, default=linear): Selects how to distribute the weights of the cluster according to its metric, two options: linear (proportional to metric) or Boltzmann weigths (proportional to exp(-metric/T). Needs to define the temperature **T**.

* **T** (*float*, default=1000): Temperature, only used for Boltzmann weights

* **condition** (*string*, default=min): Selects wether to take into account maximum or minimum values in epsilon related spawning, values are *min* or *max*

The following parameters are mandatory for **variableEpsilon**:

* **varEpsilonType** (*string*,default=linear): Selects the type of variation for the epsilon value. At the moment only a linear variation is implemented

The following parameter are mandatory for all *MSM*-based methods:

* **lagtime** (*int*): Lagtime to use when estimating the MSM

Additionally, these methods can also accept the following parameters:

  to calculate the distance to each cluster and create the probability and PMF
  plots for the MSM-based spawnings
* **SASA_column** (*int*): Column corresponding to SASA in the report files. This value is used
  to calculate the SASA of each cluster and create the probability and PMF
  plots for the MSM-based spawnings

        }
    }



Output
------

The output for each epoch is redirected to a different folder, with a name that matches the epoch number. For example, if we run three epochs, we will have three folders named
0, 1, and 2.
Aside from the regular simulation program output each directory contains a clustering subdirectory with the clustering summary information, and 
eventually, the cluster center pdb files and the clustering object. This clustering object is used to restart simulations, and only that of the last
finished epoch is kept for disk usage optimization. 
If we change a clustering parameter in a restart run, AdaptivePELE will recluster all the snapshots, which will fail if previous trajectories are not present.


Analysis
--------

In order to analyse simulation results, a bunch of scripts are provided in ``AdaptivePELE/analysis``. Get help to run them with: ``python <script> -h``

Example to print column 5 evolution with gnuplot::

    python -m AdaptivePELE.analysis.plotAdaptive 4 2 5 report_ -lines | gnuplot -persist

It prints the evolution of column 5 (e.g. RMSD) in report_* files with lines in epochs of 4 steps.

Example to print BE against RMSD with gnuplot::

    python -m AdaptivePELE.analysis.plotAdaptive 4 5 6 report_ -points | gnuplot -persist

It prints the column 6 against column 5 with points. Epoch length is ignored in this case

To plot the evolution of the number of clusters along the simulation::

    python -m AdaptivePELE.analysis.numberOfClusters -filename "plot"

It shows the evolution of the total number of clusters, and the number of clusters divided in different densities and cluster thresholds.
It also prints a histogram with the ratio of counts *r* (see above). When ``-filename`` is provided, it saves the plots as png files.


Dynamical hooks
---------------

Starting from version 1.4.2, the option of dynamically changing the cluster sizes
is implemented using a hook. This hook is a function that is passed to the
adaptive main function which accepts two arguments: *clustering* and *outputPath*
and returns two arguments: *clustering* and *hasChanged*. *clustering* refers to  the clustering object, while *hasChanged* is a boolean that marks whether any change has been done to the clustering object in the hook function. If so, the data is reclustered before starting the new iteration. One example of such function would look like::

    def hook_function(clustering, outputPath):
        hasChanged = False
        if len(clustering) < 2:
            clustering.thresholdCalculator.values = [1.5, 3]
            hasChanged = True
        return clustering, hasChanged



Non-PDB trajectories
--------------------

Starting from version 1.5, AdaptivePELE supports working with non-PDB
trajectories by relying on the mdtraj library [MDTRAJ]_, with only minor changes in
the exposed interface of the atomset module. However, some caution is needed
when using mdtraj to convert between formats:

* Mdtraj does not keep the chain names, for example, if we have a pdb with 2
  chains, *A* for the protein and *L* for the ligand, mdtraj will rewrite the
  PDB chains as *A* and *B*

* Mdtraj does not keep protonation states, for example, if we have histidines
  with different states (*HIS*, *HID* and *HIP*) all will be written as *HIS*

* Mdtraj stores atomic coordinates in nanometers which leads to lose of
  precision when converting to Amstrong, however this only affects the second
  or third decimal, so most structures should be fine

To overcome these issues, the splitTrajectories script in the analysis
subpackage can be used:::

    python -m AdaptivePELE.analysis.splitTrajectory 0/trajectory_10.xtc -o output_pdb --top topology.pdb --structs 2


The top parameter stands for topology and is necessary for dealing with xtc
trajectories. Typically is a pdb file with the description of the system. The
call shown above will extract the second, fifth and tenth snapshots of the file
0/trajectory_10.xtc into the folder output_pdb, as separate files for a system that can be
described with the file topology.pdb

If a whole trajectory has to be converted one can also use the
convertTrajectory script, also in the analysis subpackage::

    python -m AdaptivePELE.analysis.convertTrajectory 0/trajectory_3.xtc --top topology.pdb -o trajectory_0_3.pdb --dir outupt_pdb

As before, the top parameter stands for topology. The
call shown above will convert the file 0/trajectory_3.xtc into the file output_pdb/trajectory_0_3.pdb, for a system that can be
described with the file topology.pdb


Input preparation for MD
------------------------

Currently for running MD with protein-ligand systems we use AmberTools and the
gaff forcefield for the ligand, and the Amberff forcefield for the protein
(different versions can be selected see ).

Several tasks are applied to the input pdb to ensure compatibility with
AmberTools:

* Check for gaps in the structure, this only produces a warning, it's still the
  users' responsibility to provide a correct input structure.

* Correct alternative positions. If the input pdb has alternative positions we
  select the ones with higher occupancy.

* Identify disulphide bonds

* Check the protonation states of the histidine residues, the input structure
  should have the correct histidine protonation state for the model.

* Check atom names so that they match the expected names for the amber
  forcefield

Despite all this, there are still several points that the user has to keep in
mind when providing input for the MD runs:

* When working whith multiple proteins, each protein **must** be in a separate
  chain so that the processing can identify them and the resulting amber
  topology has several molecules as desired.

* The ligand in the input file can't have a name starting with a digit, since
  AmberTools does not accept residues starting with digits

* Histidines should be name *HIS* regardless of the protonation state, the code
  will detect and assign the correct template without the need of using
  alternative names such as *HIE* or *HIP* (this is particularly important when
  using constraints, see `MD Parameters`_ section for more details on the
  constraints options).

Equilibration procedure in MD
-----------------------------

The equilibration procedure followed in the MD simulations in AdaptivePELE will
be run for each initial structure independently (note that this imposes the
restriction that the **processors** parameter (i.e. the number of trajectories
in the simulation) has to be greater or equal than the number of initial
structures.

For each structure the following process is run:

    1) Energy minimization with constraints on the ligand and protein heavy
       atoms. The length of the minimiation is determined by the
       **minimizationIterations** parameter and the strength of the constraints
       is determined by the **constraintsMinimization** parameter

    2) Constant volume and temperature equilibration (NVT) with constraints on the ligand and protein heavy
       atoms. The length of the minimiation is determined by the
       **equilibrationLengthNVT** parameter and the strength of the constraints
       is determined by the **constraintsNVT** parameter

    3) Constant pressure and temperature equilibration (NPT) with constraints on the ligand heavy
       atoms and the protein alpha carbons. The length of the minimiation is determined by the
       **equilibrationLengthNPT** parameter and the strength of the constraints
       is determined by the **constraintsNPT** parameter. Note that typically
       the strength of the constraints in this last step will be lower to
       produce a gradual transition into the unconstrained production run


Running AdaptivePELE with GPUs
------------------------------

Starting from version 1.6, AdaptivePELE runs in different replicas (ony for MD
simulations), this is necessary for running multinode GPU simulations, to run
such simulation only one extra parameter is necessary, *numReplicas* (see 
`Simulation block`_ section for more details).
Here we show and example control file to run an MD simulation with 2 replicas
and 4 trajectories per replica (8 trajectories total)::

        },

        "clustering" : {
            "type" : "rmsd",
            "params" : {
                "alternativeStructure": true,

This setup will be quite typical for running in clusters like MinoTauro where
nodes contain 4 gpus. To launch this simulation we need to ensure that we run
one replica of adaptivePELE in each node. We can do it by using the srun
command in cluster that use slurm, for clusters with different software you
will need to contact the cluster support team. An example slurm file would look
like::

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --job-name="3ptb_Ad_MD_mt"
    #SBATCH -D .
    #SBATCH --output=test_3ptb_Ad_MD_mt.out
    #SBATCH --error=test_3ptb_Ad_MD_mt.err
    #SBATCH --ntasks=2
    #SBATCH --nodes=2
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16
    #SBATCH --time=01:00:00
    #SBATCH --constraint=k80
    #SBATCH --gres gpu:4

    module load intel/16.0.2 amber/16 python/2.7.2 2> /dev/null
    export PYTHONPATH="/gpfs/projects/bsc72/AdaptiveSampling/bin_mt/v1.6.2:/gpfs/projects/bsc72/lib/site-packages_minot"
    srun python -m AdaptivePELE.adaptiveSampling control_file_MD_3ptb_mt.conf

Note also that this job requests 8 cpus per replica. At least a number of cpus
per replica equal to the number of trajectories per replica are required.
Similarly, the CTE-POWER cluster also has 4 gpus per node, so the configuration
is very similar. An example for this machin would look like::

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --job-name="md_PK2_evoCt"
    #SBATCH -D .
    #SBATCH --output=md_PK2_evoCt.out
    #SBATCH --error=md_PK2_evoCt.err
    #SBATCH --ntasks=1
    #SBATCH --nodes=1
    #SBATCH --gres gpu:4
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=160
    #SBATCH --time=14:00:00

    module load python/3.6.5
    module load ambertools/18
    export PYTHONPATH="/gpfs/projects/bsc72/adaptiveSampling/bin_cte/v1.6.2:/gpfs/projects/bsc72/lib/site-packages-cte"
    srun python -m AdaptivePELE.adaptiveSampling templetized_PK2_evoCt_md.conf
